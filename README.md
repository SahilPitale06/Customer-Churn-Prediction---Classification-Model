# Customer Churn Prediction - Classification Model

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on their usage patterns and demographic data.

---

## Dataset Used
- **Name:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Description:** The dataset contains customer details, usage behavior, and churn status.

---

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Loaded the dataset and identified missing values.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values in the `TotalCharges` column.
   - Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Built a Random Forest Classifier using Scikit-learn.
   - Trained and tested the model.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Calculated accuracy and generated a classification report.
   - Saved predictions to a CSV file.

## Key Results
- **Model Performance**:
  - Accuracy: *(Add value after running the code)*

- The model provides insights into customer churn behavior and helps in customer retention.
